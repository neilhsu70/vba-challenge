I was able to run ticker.vbs on the alphabetical file but it just runs and runs (over 4 hours) on the multi year version. So I believe ticker.vbs is correct (albeit not complete because it doesn't populate the 1st challenge) So I had to remove some of the code and make ticker2.vbs so it'll run. the screen shots are from ticker2.vbs so that I can get credit. I'm not sure if it's my code or if it's my Excel program (which is the most recent version). I've included the results from my alphabetical run and have included screen shots.

Thanks
